### Goals of Bender.
* [ ] Be Syntax compatible with Clojure.
* [ ] Compatible with `clojure.core`.
* [ ] Nimble startup times No JIT by default.
* [ ] Should be as fast or faster than Lua.
* [ ] To be Faster than Lua VM without JIT.
* [ ] Hinley Millner style Type Inference.
* [ ] Immutable Datastructures.
* [ ] Tail Call Optimisation.
* [ ] Lazy/Delayed Evaluation.
* [ ] Optional Types through meta data.
* [ ] Can be Compiled to Native Code.
* [ ] Interpreted while Development.
* [ ] Be linked with C/C++ Libs.
* [ ] Use efficient GC.
* [ ] Designed with Game Development in Mind.
* [ ] Cross Platform on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, AppleTV, and Switch.
* [ ] Should use the smallest JIT available. AsmJIT, GccJit.
* [ ] To be faster than Chez by a Factor of 3 Atleast.
* [ ] Ease of use over dogma and tradition.
* [ ] Profiler and Database for type detection.
* [ ] Favour easier funtion names over Std Lib Dogma.
* [ ] Ease of Use above Performance and Performance above backward compatibility.
* [ ] Erlang Styled concurrency.
* [ ] Use ML to detect types.
* [ ] Automatic and deterministic memory management (Optional garbage collector and VM)
* [ ] Inferred static types for speed.
* [ ] Rust Styled Optional Borrowed Ownership.
* [ ] Logic Progrming Features compatible with Shen https://shenlanguage.org/TBoS/tbos.html
* [ ] No hidden performance penalties â€“ allocation and copying are explicit
* [ ] Straightforward integration with existing C code
* [ ] Lisp macros, compile time scripting and a helpful REPL
* [ ] Threads and atomic references.
* [ ] Asynchronous programming (i.e. promises & futures).
* [ ] Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).
* [ ] Software-Transactional Memory (STM).
* [ ] The actor model.
* [ ] Multi Platform  (JVM, CLR, Neko VM)
